# Course Projects

  This repository contains some of the most notable and challenging software engineering projects I've undertaken during this past (Fall 2017) semester at Bucknell University. I want to document my experience and share my work with the community.
  
  As of right now, this repository only includes two separate assignements from an Algorithms course of the Fall 2017 semester. One project is Java, and the other in Python. I will be adding projects from Operating Systems Design (Fall 2017) in the near future.
  
  I will be expanding this repository with course-related projects that are reflective of my skills and interests as time goes on.
