[PROJECT: MAX-FLOW NETWORK ANALYZER]
[GOAL: IMPLEMENT THE "FORD-FULKERSON METHOD"]

Instructions:

  In order to compile and run our program, all you have to do is run the following command from terminal in the ./source folder and ensure that you have GraphViz along with python3 on your computer.

    --> “python3 main.py”
 
  NOTE: The folders ./output_graphs and ./input_graphs must be made prior to running the python files in ./source. 
 
  The ./analysis folder contains code used to generate our charts and determine algorithm runtimes. The generators in that folder are more deterministic for smaller sizes, which is why we did not use them for the main portion of this assignment, whose purpose was to generate and analyze the max flow of pseudo-random directed graphs.

  NOTE: Similarly, the folders ./analysis/input_graphs and ./analysis/output_graphs must be made in advance if the python filed in ./analysis/analysis_source are to be run.
